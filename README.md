[![](https://ci.solanolabs.com:443/solanolabs-docker/ci_memes-docker/badges/branches/gcr?badge_token=723af94a1c9aaf664261ac5790373132425e1cac)](https://ci.solanolabs.com:443/solanolabs-docker/ci_memes-docker/suites/519281)

Example repository demonstrating Solano CI docker pull, build, test, and push. When configured
it will also pull and deploy the container from Google Container Registry (GCR).

Technologies used:

- Docker
- Google Container Registry (GCR)
- Nginx
- Mysql (only used for example purposes. Many "lighter" solutions would be more appropriate in this use case.)
